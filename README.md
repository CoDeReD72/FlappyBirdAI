## Evaluation & Future Work

This project allowed a more in-depth use of Python beyond the University curriculum and how it can be used for data science and why Python lends itself to that field, especially in data analytics and mining.

In terms of future work the following could be added: 

- Visual diagram of the NEAT network

- Generation, distance display

- Limit the number of birds shown per generation (Best x of each generation)

## Requirements
* Python 3.9
* Random
* OS
* NEAT
